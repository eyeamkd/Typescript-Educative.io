# Declaring Types in Untyped Code 

### Declare Keyword:
Declare keyword is used when we want to convey it to Typescript to explicity "declare" a variable that is "defined" someplace else. 

Types and inferences can be explicitly declared a file "d.ts" 
Tyepscript would know *not* to transpile that file into JS.
