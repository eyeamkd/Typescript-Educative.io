# Unknown Type

Unknown, as it looks, is used to define the type of the variable whose type is not known, for example

variableName : unknown
as a developer, I don't know the type of the variable "variableName", hence I'm declaring it as unknown.

But as soon as I start using it, I gotta declare the type, for example

variableName *as string* 

unknown and null are both falsy
