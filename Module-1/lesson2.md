# Why use Typescript 

1. Using typescript, same codebase can generate multiple different versions of JS. That means, you can ship old JS to clients like IE, and ES8 to clients like Chrome 
2. Changing types, will highlight incompatibility straight in the IDE without even trying to run the code 
3. Great autocomplete features provided
